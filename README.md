# Task 2 – Basic CRUD Application

This repository contains **Task 2** of my project work, where I built a **Basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Application** using **PHP, MySQL, and XAMPP**.  
The main objective of this task was to understand and implement the fundamental operations that every dynamic web application needs.

## 🚀 Features Implemented
1. **Create** – Add new posts through a form and save them into the database.  
2. **Read** – Display all posts in a structured list/table format.  
3. **Update** – Edit an existing post and update it in the database.  
4. **Delete** – Remove unwanted posts from the database permanently.  
5. **Validation** – Basic form validation to ensure required fields are not empty.  
6. **Database Connection** – Reusable PDO-based connection file for secure database access.  
7. **Clean Code Structure** – Separate PHP files for each operation (`create.php`, `edit.php`, `delete.php`, `index.php`) for better maintainability.
